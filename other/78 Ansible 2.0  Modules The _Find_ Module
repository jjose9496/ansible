reate a playbook, using the 'find' module that accomplishes the following:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to one server or group from Step #2 above
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Search the remote system /etc directory for the fstab file
